## Lesson Content

Upstart is an event-based init system used in some **upstart linux** distributions to manage services and tasks during boot and while the system is running. It operates through a system of jobs and events. While tracing the origin of every event can be complex, often requiring you to explore job configurations in `/etc/init`, you will more commonly need to manage these jobs directly from the command line. The `initctl` utility provides a suite of commands for this purpose.

### Viewing Job Status

To see a list of all known Upstart jobs and their current states, use the `list` command.

```plaintext
initctl list

shutdown stop/waiting
console stop/waiting
...
```

The output displays the job name, its goal, and its current status. In the example `shutdown stop/waiting`, the job name is `shutdown`, its goal is `stop`, and its current status is `waiting`. The job status and goals will change as you interact with them.

To check the status of a specific job, use the `status` command.

```plaintext
initctl status networking
networking start/running
```

### Manually Controlling Jobs

While job configuration files in `/etc/init` define how jobs start, stop, and interact with events, you can manually override these actions using `initctl`. This is useful for troubleshooting or performing administrative tasks.

To manually start a job:

```bash
sudo initctl start networking
```

To manually stop a job:

```bash
sudo initctl stop networking
```

To manually restart a job, which is a convenient shortcut for stopping and then starting it:

```bash
sudo initctl restart networking
```

### Emitting Custom Events

Upstart jobs are triggered by events. You can also manually "emit" an event, which can be useful for triggering custom jobs or for testing purposes. Any job that is configured to start on `some_event` would be triggered by the following command.

```bash
sudo initctl emit some_event
```

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! While there are no specific labs for Upstart, understanding how to schedule and manage tasks is crucial for controlling system processes. Here's a hands-on lab to reinforce your understanding of task management:

1. **[Schedule Tasks with at and cron in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-schedule-tasks-with-at-and-cron-in-linux-590870)** - Practice creating, managing, and removing one-time and recurring jobs, which are fundamental concepts related to how services and tasks are managed in Linux environments like those handled by Upstart.

This lab will help you apply the concepts of task automation in real scenarios and build confidence with managing system operations.
