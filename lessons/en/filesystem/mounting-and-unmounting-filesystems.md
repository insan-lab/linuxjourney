## Lesson Content

Before you can access the files on a storage device, you must first mount its filesystem to a directory on your system. This process involves a device location, a filesystem type, and a mount point. The mount point is simply an existing directory where the filesystem will be attached.

### How to Mount a Filesystem

First, you need to create a mount point. Let's create a directory for this purpose:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mydrive
```

With the mount point ready, you can use the `mount` command to attach your device. The `-t` flag specifies the filesystem type.

```bash
sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb2 /mydrive
```

It's as simple as that! Now, if you navigate to the `/mydrive` directory, you will see the contents of your device's filesystem.

### How to Unmount a Filesystem in Linux

When you are finished with a device, you should unmount it to ensure all data is safely written and the filesystem is cleanly detached. The standard command for this operation in Linux is `umount`. To perform a `linux unmount`, you can specify either the mount point or the device name.

Using the mount point:

```bash
sudo umount /mydrive
```

Alternatively, using the device name:

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sdb2
```

It is best practice to use `sudo umount` to ensure you have the necessary permissions to detach the filesystem. This command is universal across Linux distributions, so the same syntax applies whether you are on Ubuntu, Fedora, or performing a `debian umount`. Note that you cannot `umount` a device if it is currently in use (e.g., if a file is open or your current working directory is on the device).

### Using UUIDs for Stable Mounting

The kernel names devices in the order it discovers them, which means a device name like `/dev/sdb2` could change between reboots. To avoid issues, you can use a device's universally unique ID (UUID), which remains constant.

To view the UUIDs for your block devices, use the `blkid` command:

```bash
pete@icebox:~$ sudo blkid
/dev/sda1: UUID="130b882f-7d79-436d-a096-1e594c92bb76" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sda5: UUID="22c3d34b-467e-467c-b44d-f03803c2c526" TYPE="swap"
/dev/sda6: UUID="78d203a0-7c18-49bd-9e07-54f44cdb5726" TYPE="xfs"
```

This output shows device names, their filesystem types, and their corresponding UUIDs. You can then mount a device using its UUID:

```bash
sudo mount UUID=130b882f-7d79-436d-a096-1e594c92bb76 /mydrive
```

While you won't always need to mount devices via their UUIDs, it is the recommended method for automatically mounting filesystems at startup, such as a secondary hard drive. We will cover that process in the next lesson.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here is a hands-on lab to reinforce your understanding of managing Linux filesystems:

- **[Manage Linux Partitions and Filesystems](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-manage-linux-partitions-and-filesystems-590845)** - In this lab, you will learn to manage disk partitions and filesystems in Linux. You'll use fdisk to create a new partition, format it with ext4, mount it, configure persistent mounting in /etc/fstab, and create a swap partition, all on a safe secondary virtual disk.

This lab will help you apply the concepts of mounting and unmounting in real scenarios and build confidence with filesystem management.
