## Lesson Content

### What is Red Hat Enterprise Linux

Red Hat Enterprise Linux, often called RHEL, is a commercial Linux distribution developed by Red Hat for the corporate market. It is a leading choice for an **enterprise linux** operating system, built to provide long-term stability, security, and professional support. While RHEL requires a subscription for use in production, Red Hat provides its source code freely, which forms the basis for other distributions.

### Package Management with RPM

RHEL uses the RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) format for its software packages. For managing these packages, it provides high-level tools like YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) and its successor, DNF (Dandified YUM). This is a key difference from distributions like Debian or Ubuntu, which are sometimes used as **debian enterprise linux** alternatives and use the `.deb` package format with the APT package manager.

### The Enterprise Advantage

The primary appeal of RHEL lies in its suitability for **enterprise linux systems**. It is designed for mission-critical workloads, offering a predictable release cycle, long-term support (up to 10 years or more), and a vast ecosystem of certified hardware and software. This makes it a reliable foundation for servers, cloud computing, and containerized applications in large-scale corporate environments.

### RHEL and its Ecosystem

To understand RHEL's place, it's helpful to know its relationship with other distributions. Fedora serves as the upstream, community-driven project where new features are developed and tested. These innovations are then refined and stabilized for inclusion in future versions of RHEL. CentOS Stream now serves as the development branch for upcoming RHEL releases.

### Professional Certification Path

For those looking to **learn Red Hat Enterprise Linux** professionally, Red Hat offers a well-respected **certification redhat** program. Key certifications include the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) and Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE). These credentials are highly valued by employers and demonstrate a high level of expertise in managing RHEL environments.

## Exercise

To practice fundamental Linux skills, try these hands-on labs focused on user and group management:

1. **[User Account Management](https://labex.io/labs/linux-user-account-management-49)** - In this lab, you will learn how to manage user accounts in the Linux platform, such as creating new user accounts, modifying user account management, and deleting a user account.
2. **[Linux User Group and File Permissions](https://labex.io/labs/linux-linux-user-group-and-file-permissions-18002)** - Learn essential Linux user and group management concepts, including creating and managing users, exploring group memberships, understanding file permissions, and manipulating file ownership.
3. **[Add New User and Group](https://labex.io/labs/linux-add-new-user-and-group-17987)** - In this challenge, you'll simulate adding new team members to a server environment by creating new user accounts, setting up custom groups, and managing group memberships.

These labs will help you apply the concepts in real scenarios and build confidence with user and group administration and file permissions in Linux.
