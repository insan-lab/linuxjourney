## Lesson Content

In our previous lesson, we learned about redirecting the standard output (stdout) stream. Similarly, we can also manage the standard input (`stdin`) stream. By default, a program receives its `stdin` from the keyboard, but we can also use files or the output from other processes as an input source.

### Understanding stdin and stdout

Every command-line process in Linux operates with at least two fundamental data streams: standard input (`stdin`) and standard output (`stdout`). A program reads data from `stdin` and writes its results to `stdout`. Understanding how to control both `stdin and stdout` is crucial for effective command-line work.

### How to Redirect stdin

Just as we use `>` for stdout redirection, we use the `<` operator to `redirect stdin`. This powerful feature allows you to tell a command to read its input from a file instead of waiting for you to type it on the keyboard. This is a core concept of input redirection.

### Practical Example with cat stdin

Let's revisit the `peanuts.txt` file from the previous lesson, which contains the text "Hello World". Consider the following command:

```bash
cat < peanuts.txt > banana.txt
```

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what happens:

1.  The `< peanuts.txt` part tells the shell to `redirect stdin` for the `cat` command, making it read from `peanuts.txt` instead of the keyboard.
2.  The `cat` command processes its input. In this case, using `cat stdin` means it reads the content of `peanuts.txt`.
3.  The `> banana.txt` part redirects the standard output of `cat` to a new file named `banana.txt`.

Ultimately, the content of `peanuts.txt` is copied to `banana.txt`. This example effectively demonstrates how to manage both `stdin and stdout` in a single, efficient command.

## Exercise

To solidify your understanding, try these hands-on exercises focused on input and output redirection in Linux:

1.  **[Redirecting Input and Output in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-redirecting-input-and-output-in-linux-590840)** - Practice controlling data flow from commands by manipulating standard output (stdout), standard error (stderr), and standard input (stdin) using operators like >, >>, 2>, and the tee command.
2.  **[Data Stream Redirection](https://labex.io/labs/linux-data-stream-redirection-17995)** - Learn the art of Linux stream redirection. Manipulate standard input, output, and error streams, combine outputs, and utilize /dev/null for advanced file operations.
3.  **[Sequence Control and Pipeline](https://labex.io/labs/linux-sequence-control-and-pipeline-17994)** - Learn to control command execution sequences and utilize pipelines, which are fundamental to directing output from one command as input to another.

These labs will help you apply the concepts of input and output redirection in real scenarios and build confidence with shell scripting and data manipulation.
