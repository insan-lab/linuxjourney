## Lesson Content

A Linux system is composed of many software components, such as web browsers, text editors, and media players. These components are known as packages, and they are typically managed by a package manager, which handles the installation, update, and removal of software. Understanding this process is a fundamental part of the **best way to learn linux**.

### What Are Linux Packages

You might know software by names like Chrome or Firefox, but on a technical level, they are packages. A package is essentially an archive पानी of files, including the application's executables, configuration files, and documentation, all bundled together. This organized structure simplifies software management.

### The Software Supply Chain

The journey of a software package involves two key roles:

- **Upstream Providers**: These are the developers who write the software. They compile the source code, create installation instructions, and release new versions and updates.
- **Package Maintainers**: When a new version is ready, upstream providers send it to package maintainers. These maintainers review, manage, and distribute the software to end-users in the form of packages tailored for specific Linux distributions.

### Common Package Formats

While you can install software directly from its source code, using a package manager is far more common and efficient. It's one of the **best ways to learn linux commands** for system administration. There are two predominant package formats:

- **Debian (.deb)**: Used by Debian and its derivatives, such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint.
- **Red Hat Package Manager (.rpm)**: Used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Fedora, and CentOS.

Mastering the tools εταιρεία to manage these packages is the **best way to learn linux command line** and is a skill you will use constantly. These tools are some of the **best resources to learn linux** system administration.

## Exercise

To apply your knowledge, we recommend these hands-on labs. They provide practical experience with the concepts covered in this lesson.

1. **[Managing Packages with RPM in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/rhel-managing-packages-with-rpm-in-linux-590868)** - Gain hands-on experience querying package info, verifying integrity, and inspecting RPM package contents on Red Hat-based systems.
2. **[Query and Update Packages with YUM in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/rhel-query-and-update-packages-with-yum-in-linux-590869)** - Learn to manage software packages on RHEL-based Linux systems using YUM, including inspecting, updating, and exploring repositories.
3. **[Build Software from Source Code in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-build-software-from-source-code-in-linux-590853)** - Understand the fundamental process of building and installing software from its source code, a crucial skill for applications not available via package managers.

These labs will help you apply the concepts of package management and software installation in real scenarios and build confidence with Linux system administration.
