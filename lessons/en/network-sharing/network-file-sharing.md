## Lesson Content

In most modern computing environments, your machine is rarely isolated. Whether at home or in a corporate setting, you are typically part of a network. When you need to transfer data between computers, you could use a USB drive, but for machines on the same network, network file sharing is far more efficient. This is a foundational skill for anyone serious about `coding in linux` or managing systems.

This lesson, part of what many consider the `best linux course online free`, will introduce you to methods for copying data across a network. We will start with simple file transfers and later discuss mounting entire remote directories, making them appear as local drives on your machine. This site aims to be the `best website to learn linux` by providing clear, practical examples.

### The Secure Copy Command (scp)

One of the simplest and most powerful tools for this task is the `scp` command, which stands for "secure copy." It functions much like the standard `cp` command but extends its capability across the network. Understanding it is one of the `best ways to learn linux commands` for network interaction. Because `scp` operates over SSH (Secure Shell), all transfers benefit from the same robust authentication and security protocols.

### Common scp Command Examples

Let's explore some practical examples. The syntax is straightforward: `scp [options] source destination`. The key difference from `cp` is that the source or destination includes a remote host specification in the format `username@remotehost:/path/to/file`.

### Copy a file from a local host to a remote host

This command sends a local file to a specified directory on a remote machine.

```bash
scp myfile.txt username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory
```

### Copy a file from a remote host to your local host

This command retrieves a file from a remote machine and saves it to a local directory.

```bash
scp username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory/myfile.txt /local/directory
```

### Copy a directory from your local host to a remote host

To copy an entire directory and its contents, use the `-r` (recursive) option.

```bash
scp -r mydir username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory
```

Mastering `scp` is an essential step, and exploring such tools is why many consider this one of the `best resources to learn linux`.

## Exercise

Practice is key to mastering new commands. To reinforce your understanding of secure network file transfer, we recommend this hands-on lab:

1. **[Secure Remote Access in Linux with SSH](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-secure-remote-access-in-linux-with-ssh-592816)** - Practice key-based authentication, securely transferring files with `scp`, and creating SSH tunnels for port forwarding.

This lab will help you apply the concepts of secure remote access and file transfer in a real-world scenario and build confidence with `scp`.
