## Lesson Content

As you've learned, the kernel is the core of the operating system. To truly understand Linux, we must see how all its parts work together. This lesson provides a high-level overview, a critical first step in your linux jorney.

The Linux operating system can be organized into three different levels of abstraction.

### The System Hardware

The most basic level is the hardware. This includes the CPU, memory (RAM), hard disks, networking ports, and other physical devices. This layer is the foundation that performs the actual computations and actions for our machine.

### The Linux Kernel

The next level is the kernel. The kernel's primary job is to act as a bridge, communicating with the hardware to execute the tasks requested by our processes. It handles process and memory management, device communication, system calls, and setting up the filesystem. This is a central theme you'll explore on linux jorney.com.

### The User Space

The level you are most familiar with is the user space. This includes the shell, the programs you run, graphical interfaces, and all other applications. These programs interact with the kernel to get work done, without needing to know the specific details of the underlying hardware.

In this course, we will dive deep into the kernel, demystifying its complexities. This part of your linux journe will be challenging but rewarding.

## Exercise

To put theory into practice, try these hands-on labs. They will reinforce your understanding of the Linux kernel and its interaction with system components:

1.  **[Manage Kernel Modules in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-manage-kernel-modules-in-linux-590865)** - Practice listing, inspecting, loading, and unloading kernel modules, and configuring them for automatic loading at boot.
2.  **[Explore Hardware Devices in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-explore-hardware-devices-in-linux-590861)** - Learn to identify and inspect hardware devices within a Linux environment using command-line utilities.
3.  **[Manage Linux Partitions and Filesystems](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-manage-linux-partitions-and-filesystems-590845)** - Gain hands-on experience with creating partitions, formatting filesystems, mounting them, and configuring persistent mounting, all managed by the kernel.

These labs will help you apply the concepts of kernel interaction with hardware and system resources in real scenarios and build confidence with low-level Linux administration.
