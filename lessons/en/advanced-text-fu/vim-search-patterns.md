## Lesson Content

Searching for text is a fundamental task in any editor. Vim provides powerful and fast ways to perform a `vim search` directly from normal mode. Let's explore how to use these search patterns to improve your workflow.

### Forward Search

To perform a standard forward `vim search`, simply press the `/` key in normal mode, followed by your search term. When you press Enter, Vim will jump to the first occurrence of the term after your cursor.

```plaintext
My pretty file is very pretty.

/pretty

This will find the first "pretty" word after the cursor.
```

### Backward Search

Similarly, you can search backward from your cursor's position. Use the `?` key followed by your search term. Vim will find the first occurrence before your cursor.

```plaintext
My pretty file is very pretty.

?pretty

This will find the last "pretty" word in the file first.
```

### Navigating Search Results

Once a search is initiated, you can easily navigate through all the matches in the file.

- Press `n` to jump to the **next** match in the direction of the original search.
- Press `N` to jump to the **previous** match, moving in the opposite direction of the original search.

### Effective Vim Lookup

The `/` and `?` commands are the core of any `vim lookup` operation. Whether you need to find a specific function name, a variable, or just a word, this search mechanism is your primary tool. Mastering this simple `vim lookup` process is essential for efficient navigation and editing.
