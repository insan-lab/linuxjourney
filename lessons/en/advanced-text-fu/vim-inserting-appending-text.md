## Lesson Content

In Vim, you'll primarily work in two modes: Normal mode for executing commands and Insert mode for typing text. To switch from Insert mode back to Normal mode, simply press the `Esc` key.

There are several commands to enter Insert mode, each placing the cursor at a different starting position for your text entry.

### Basic Insert Commands

The most fundamental way to start typing is with the `i` command.

- `i` – **i**nsert text before the current cursor position.

This command switches you to Insert mode, allowing you to type directly into the file.

### Vim Append vs Insert

A common point of comparison is **vim append vs insert**. While both enter Insert mode, their starting points differ relative to the cursor. Understanding the **vim insert vs append** distinction is key to efficient movement and editing.

- `a` – **a**ppend text after the current cursor position.
- `I` – **I**nsert text at the beginning of the current line.
- `A` – **A**ppend text at the end of the current line.

Using `a` instead of `i` saves you a keystroke (moving the cursor one space to the right before inserting). Similarly, `A` is a powerful shortcut to immediately start typing at the end of a line. Mastering the `vim append` commands is a significant step in improving your editing speed.

### How to Vim Add Line

When you need to add new lines of text, you don't have to manually press Enter at the end of a line. Vim provides dedicated commands to open lines and immediately enter Insert mode.

- `o` – **o**pen a new line below the current line and enter Insert mode.
- `O` – **O**pen a new line above the current line and enter Insert mode.

These commands are extremely useful when you need to quickly **vim add line** while coding or writing.

Tip: You can prefix these commands with a number to repeat them. For example, typing `3o` in Normal mode will open three new blank lines below the current one and place you in Insert mode on the first of these new lines.
